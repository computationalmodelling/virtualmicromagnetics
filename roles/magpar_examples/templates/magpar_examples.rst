Magpar Examples
---------------

Examples of magpar are available in a seperate tarball to the one used for
installing magpar itself. The examples are already prepared on this virtual
machine (albeit slightly modified), but can be found at::

    ~/magpar-0_9_ex.tar.gz

To run one of these examples, simply navigate to the directory containing the
example and execute the run command using bash, like so::

    cd ~/magpar-examples/sphere_demag/
    bash run

This script will produce some output files visible in the directory.
