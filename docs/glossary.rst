   Box File
       A file used by :term:`Vagrant` to create :term:`Vagrant
       environment`\s. A box file represents a template from which
       :term:`virtual machine`\s can be created.

   Container
       "Containers are a lightweight virtualization method for running multiple
       isolated Linux systems under a common host operating system"
       [#jacobsen15]_

       As with :term:`virtual machine`\s, containers are a virtualisation
       medium. Unlike virtual machines however, they use components of the host
       operating system. This reduces their size at the cost of reduced
       isolation from the host machine.

   Host
   Host Machine
       A machine that uses virtualisation software to host :term:`virtual
       machine`\s and/or :term:`container`\s. Host machines allocate resources,
       including memory and disk space, to support the running of a virtual
       machine or container. Note that a virtual machine can host other virtual
       machines, making it both a host and a virtual machine.

   Idempotent
   Idempotency
       Idempotent :term:`provisioning` runs only the commands required to
       achieve the desired state of the system. Commands that do not change the
       state are not run. This can save considerable build time when handling
       dependencies, because a dependency should not be downloaded and
       reinstalled if it is already in the state it should be in.

   Manager
   Vagrant
       Manager software provides an interface for managing :term:`virtual
       machine`\s and :term:`container`\s. Vagrant is an example of manager
       software, which provides a command-line interface to virtual machine and
       container management which can be automated. See
       :ref:`vm-software-managers`.

   Vagrant Environment
       The directory structure (including ``Vagrantfile``) created by Vagrant
       when ``vagrant init`` is commanded. A single :term:`virtual machine` or
       :term:`container` can be managed in a given environment.

   Virtual Environment
       Virtual environments produce the same :term:`virtual machine` or
       :term:`container` on all virtualisation-capable computers. Virtual
       environments are also :term:`box file`\s, but are not
       :term:`Vagrant environment`\s.

   Provider
   Docker
   Virtualiser
   VirtualBox
       Provider (or virtualiser) software supports the creation of, and
       interaction with, :term:`virtual machine`\s or :term:`container`\s from
       a host machine. VirtualBox and Docker are examples of free provider
       software for virtual machines and containers respectively. See
       :ref:`vm-software-providers`.

   Provisioner
   Provisioning
   Ansible
       Provisioner software runs a set of commands on a machine, virtual or
       otherwise, to ensure it is in a particular state. Ansible is an example
       of provisioner software that enables :term:`idempotent`
       provisioning. See :ref:`vm-software-provisioners`.

   System Virtual Machine
   Virtual Machine
       "An efficient, isolated duplicate of a real machine." [#smith05]_

       Software that imitates certain other software on certain hardware. In
       this project, this includes a complete operating system, and a
       combination of one or many simulation packages and dependencies. General
       system virtual machines are described in brief at
       :ref:`vm-software`.

       More strictly, a virtual machine is a specific instance of a
       :term:`virtual environment`. When we build :term:`box file` artefacts,
       we are creating :term:`virtual environment`\s, not virtual
       machines. Once :term:`Vagrant` creates a :term:`Vagrant environment`
       from a :term:`box file` and ``vagrant up`` is commanded, a corresponding
       virtual machine is created. Virtual machines created on a :term:`host`
       are managed by virtual machine :term:`provider`\s, which typically list
       the machines they are maintaining.

   Virtual Micromagnetics
       "Enabling accessible and reproducible micromagnetic simulation."

       The name of this project, which represents the collection of virtual
       environments and the software written to create them.
