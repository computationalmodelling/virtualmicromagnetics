   Box File
      A file used by :term:`Vagrant` to create :term:`Vagrant environment`\s. A
      box file represents a template from which :term:`Virtual machine`\s can
      be created.

   Manager
   Vagrant
       See :ref:`introduction-managers`.

   Vagrant Environment
       The directory structure (including ``Vagrantfile``) created by Vagrant
       when ``vagrant init`` is called. A single virtual machine can be managed
       in a given environment.

   Virtual Environment
       Virtual environments produce the same :term:`virtual machine` on all
       virtualisation-capable computers. Virtual environments are also
       :term:`box file`\s, but are not :term:`Vagrant environment`\s.

   Provider
   VirtualBox
       See :ref:`introduction-providers`.

   Provisioner
   Ansible
       See :ref:`introduction-provisioners`.

   System Virtual Machine
   Virtual Machine
       "An efficient, isolated duplicate of a real machine." [#smith05]_

       Software that imitates certain other software on certain hardware. In
       this project, this includes a complete operating system, and a
       combination of one or many simulation packages and dependencies. General
       system virtual machines are described in brief at
       :ref:`introduction-vms`.

       More strictly, a virtual machine is a specific instance of a
       :term:`virtual environment`. When we build :term:`box file` artefacts,
       we are creating :term:`virtual environment`\s, not virtual
       machines. Once :term:`Vagrant` creates a :term:`Vagrant environment`
       from a :term:`box file` and ``vagrant up`` is commanded, a corresponding
       virtual machine is created. Virtual machines created on a host are
       managed by virtual machine :term:`provider`\s, which typically list the
       machines they are maintaining.

   Virtual Micromagnetics
       "Enabling accessible and reproducible micromagnetic simulation."

       The name of this project, which represents the collection of virtual
       environments and the software written to create them.
