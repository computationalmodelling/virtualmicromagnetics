Virtual Micromagnetics Documentation
====================================

Welcome to the :term:`Virtual Micromagnetics` project, where we aim to enable
accessible and reproducible micromagnetics simulation, without compromise.

The :term:`Virtual Micromagnetics` project creates :term:`virtual
environment`\s that run micromagnetic (and in some cases, atomistic)
simulations of magnetic behaviour. These environments produce :term:`system
virtual machine`\s which emulate a configured set of software on your
computer. This means you as a user only need to manage the software to support
the virtual machine, as opposed to the complicated set of dependencies most
simulation packages require. As a result, these virtual environments are far
simpler to maintain, meaning you have more time to solve the mysteries of the
universe instead of:

 - wondering why the latest version of a package is incompatible with earlier
   simulations.

 - wondering how to maintain multiple versions of a package to support old
   simulation software.

 - persuading your high-performance computing system administrator to support
   your long list of software dependencies.

 - setting up user accounts and packages for new students to run simulations.
