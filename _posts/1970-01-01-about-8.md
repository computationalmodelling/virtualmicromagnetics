If you are working on an open-source micromagnetics simulator, feel free to
talk to us if you wish to include your work in the Virtual Micromagnetics
environment. If you wish to contribute to the project, you can first look at
our project in more detail on
[GitHub](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/virtualmicromagnetics/).
Suggestions and comments are also welcome.
