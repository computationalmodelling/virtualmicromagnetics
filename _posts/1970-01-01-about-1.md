title: Virtual Micromagnetics
---

Virtual Micromagnetics is an environment that creates [system virtual
machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#System_virtual_machines)
designed for high-performance, reproducible, and distributable research. This
essentially means it emulates a configured set of software on your
computer. Instead of managing many different software packages on your computer
for simulation, you only need to manage the single software that supports the
virtual machine. This creates an environment far simpler to maintain for
research, meaning you have more time to solve the mysteries of the universe,
instead of:

- wondering why the latest version of a package is incompatible with earlier
  simulations.

- wondering how to maintain multiple versions of a package to support old
  simulation software.

- persuading your (high-performance-computing) system administrator to support
  your software.

- setting up user accounts and packages for new students to run simulations.
