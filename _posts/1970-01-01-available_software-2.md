A light version of Virtual micromagnetics is also available for
[download](/download/),
which includes only the micromagnetic simulation software and its
dependencies. If you're looking for an even more streamlined Virtual
Micromagnetics environment, consider building Virtual Micromagnetics projects
from scratch using our
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/fangohr/virtualmicromagnetics) repository,
where you can choose the software you want to include.
