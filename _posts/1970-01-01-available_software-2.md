A light version of Virtual micromagnetics is also available, which includes
only the micromagnetic simulation software and its dependencies. Other
specialist environments are available if you wish to use only one of the above
packages [here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/virtualmicromagnetics). If you're
looking for an even more streamlined Virtual Micromagnetics environment,
consider building Virtual Micromagnetics projects from scratch using our
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/computationalmodelling/virtualmicromagnetics)
repository, where you can choose the software you want to include.
