From Scratch
------------

In order to use the Virtual Micromagnetics environment, you will need to
download and install a virtual machine provider. One such provider is
[VirtualBox 5.0](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), which we recommend
and support, but others are available.

Get the [latest build zip
file](/download/),
and unzip it to obtain the full Virtual Micromagnetics hard
disk. [Create](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#gui-createvm) your
Virtual Micromagnetics VM from the hard disk using your provider (VirtualBox),
and [run](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#idp46730486114432) the
VM. When prompted, log in as:

- User: virtualmicromagnetics
- Password: virtualmicromagnetics

After login, follow the instructions in the welcome file on the desktop to run
some simulations with the pre-installed packages. Some familiarity with [Ubuntu
GNU/Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/) is recommended. Never worry about software
dependencies again!
