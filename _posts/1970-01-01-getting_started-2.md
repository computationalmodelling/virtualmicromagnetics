Alternatively, you can use the Virtual Micromagnetics environment from the
virtual machines directly. To do this, you will need to download and install a
virtual machine provider. One such provider is [VirtualBox
5.0](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), which we recommend and
support, but others are available.

Get the [latest build zip file](/virtualmicromagnetics/hard_disks/), and unzip
it to obtain the full Virtual Micromagnetics hard
disk. [Create](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#gui-createvm) your
Virtual Micromagnetics VM from the hard disk using your provider (VirtualBox),
and [run](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#idp46730486114432) the
VM. You may need the following user credentials:

- User: virtualmicromagnetics
- Password: virtualmicromagnetics

After login, follow the instructions in the welcome file on the desktop to run
some simulations with the pre-installed packages. Some familiarity with [Ubuntu
GNU/Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/) is recommended. Never worry about software
dependencies again!
