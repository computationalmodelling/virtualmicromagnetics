title: Deployment with Vagrant and VirtualBox
---

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a software that allows the user to
deploy development environments, like Virtual Micromagnetics. Its friendly
command-line interface is the primary way to construct and manage Virtual
Micromagnetics environments. The provider we support for Vagrant environments
is [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), which directly manages virtual
machines. We recommend the user download both of these packages to use the
Virtual Micromagnetics environment, but they are not mandatory if one wants to
use Virtual Micromagnetics from scratch (see [Get
Started](/virtualmicromagnetics/get_started/)).
