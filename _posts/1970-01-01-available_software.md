Software List
-------------

What follows is a list of software installed on the Full Virtual Micromagnetics
environment. It is not comprehensive.

Micromagnetic Simulation Software:

- [OOMMF](http://math.nist.gov/oommf/)
- [MagPar](http://www.magpar.net/)
- [NMag](http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/nmag/)

Infrastructure:

- [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) 14.04
- [XFCE4](http://www.xfce.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7, [IPython](http://ipython.org/)

Other Software:

- [Cython](http://cython.org/)
- [FEniCS](http://fenicsproject.org/)
- [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/)
- [Netgen](https://sourceforge.net/projects/netgen-mesher/)
- [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/)
- [Sundials](http://acts.nersc.gov/sundials/)

There's a lot of software here I will never use...
--------------------------------------------------

A light version of Virtual micromagnetics is also available for
[download](/download/),
which includes only the micromagnetic simulation software and its
dependencies. If you're looking for an even more streamlined Virtual
Micromagnetics environment, consider building Virtual Micromagnetics projects
from scratch using our
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/fangohr/virtualmicromagnetics) repository,
where you can choose the software you want to include.

Missing Something?
------------------

The Virtual Micromagnetics environment is flexible in that, once [set
up](/get_started/), further packages can be installed. This includes
proprietary software if Virtual Micromagnetics is for personal use. If you have
some open-source micromagnetics simulation software that you feel should belong
as part of this project, please [contact us](/about/).
