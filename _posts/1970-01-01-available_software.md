Missing Something?
------------------

The Virtual Micromagnetics environment is flexible in that, once [set
up](/get_started/), further packages can be installed. This includes
proprietary software if Virtual Micromagnetics is for personal use. If you have
some open-source micromagnetics simulation software that you feel should belong
as part of this project, please [contact us](/about/).
