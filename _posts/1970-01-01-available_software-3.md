The Virtual Micromagnetics environment is flexible in that, once [set
up](/virtualmicromagnetics/get_started/), further packages can be
installed. This includes proprietary software if Virtual Micromagnetics is for
personal use. If you have some open-source micromagnetics simulation software
that you feel should belong as part of this project, please [contact
us](/virtualmicromagnetics/about/).
