Welcome to the Lite Virtual Micromagnetics Simulation Environment!
------------------------------------------------------------------

This virtual machine contains a number of distributable software packages that
are often used by the micromagnetic community to simulate relevant
problems. These software can be downloaded from this machine; tarballs are
available in the home directory. Micromagnetic software includes (in no
particular order):

  | OOMMF 1.2a5 (The Object Oriented MicroMagnetic Framework): http://math.nist.gov/oommf/
  | Documentation: http://math.nist.gov/oommf/doc/

  | Nmag 0.2: http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/nmag/
  | Documentation: http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/nmag/current/manual/singlehtml/manual.html

  | magpar 0.9 (Parallel Finite Element Micromagnetics Package): http://www.magpar.net/
  | Documentation: http://www.magpar.net/static/magpar-0.9/doc/html/

  | Fidimag 1.0 (Finite-difference Micromagnetic and Atomistic Package): http://computationalmodelling.github.io/fidimag/
  | Documentation: http://fidimag.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

For more information about these packages, see their respective websites and
examples available on the desktop, which walk the user through some examples
and tests where applicable.
